## Project Objective: Intelligent Agent for Rock-Scissor-Paper Game

The goal of this project is to develop an intelligent agent capable of learning to play the Rock-Scissor-Paper game. Specifically, the agent has to be able to recognize an image representing one of the available moves (Rock, Scissor, Paper) and autonomously select the corresponding move that beats the observed one. In this project, several machine learning models were employed in order to assess their performance in this task and select the best one. All models were trained on a [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/drgfreeman/rockpaperscissors) that has been obtained from Kaggle and contains images of hand gestures from the Rock-Paper-Scissors game.
